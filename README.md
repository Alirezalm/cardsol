### Cardinality Constrained Quadratic Optimization Solver (cardsol)

---
*cardsol* is a small package for solving mathematical optimization problems of convex Cardinality Constrained Quadratic
Optimization (CCQP) problems. 
---
cardsol translates the CCQP problem into a Mixed-Integer Optimization Problem (MIQP) provides 
the following algorithms to solve it:

1. Outer Approximation (OA) method
2. LP/NLP based Branch and Bound method
---

### Dependencies
1. Scipy
2. Numpy
3. Gurobipy and gurobi solver
